Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a
researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at
least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
